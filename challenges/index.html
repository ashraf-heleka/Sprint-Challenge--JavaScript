  <p>
    Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.
    
    forEach modifies the original array, while map results in a new array.

    What is the difference between a function and a method?
    
    Both are functions, but a method is a function that belongs to an object

    What is closure?
    
    If a variable isn’t defined within a function’s scope, the function will look outside its scope to search for a variable being referenced in the outer scope.

    Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
    
    Implicit binding: look at the left of "." when calling
    
    Explicit binding: using call, apply, bind to identify meaning of this
    
    New binding: when function invoked with the "new" keyword, this is bound to new object being constructed
    
    Window binding: if none of the above apply, then this will apply to window (unless strict mode is on)

    Why do we need super() in an extended class? 
    
    To set all of parent’s properties onto child (extension of child attributes)
